## Method

Consider a particular **method** or particular methodological approach that you would use for a doctoral research project (e.g. questionnaire, interview, observation, focus group, secondary data analysis). **Explain** the **principles** on which you would design your ‘instrument’ and the **opportunities** and **problems** you foresee and/or might experience.

## Topic

## Research question 

:::{.incremental}

- **Which types of experts today make knowledge claims about social aspects of AI across the sciences, engineering, social science and humanities?**

- How is epistemic relevance and authority established in the AI research field? 

- What kinds of knowledge claims become influential in policy and media domains?

:::

## Focus

Formal academic communication:

- academic journals
- conference proceedings
- archives
- ...

## Scientometrics

## How?

![Hervas-Oliver and Albors 2015](images/methods.png)

## Let the issues begin...

**Unit**:

- researchers
- papers
- journals

**Data collection + sampling:**

- peer-reviewed academic journals (Scopus, Web of Science)
- archives (e.g. arXiv)
- keywords

##

**Making sense:**

- network analysis
  - nodes and edges
- tables not as useful anymore

## Visual Network Analysis

## 

- relational data exploration 
  - mapping and spatialisation (force-directed layouts?)
- community detection (non/algorithmic)
- Interpretative turn in network science?
  - from positivism to interpretivism
  - quant + qual?

## Algortihms and software

- Gephi, VosViewer, Python, R
  - degree of control and unboxing the "black box"
      - open source
  - degree of reproducibility
  - ethics + reflexivity
- Different spatialisation algorithms in different tools
  - how does it shape the understanding of a network?
- community detection 
- visualisation design
  - static/interactive

## Major issue points

What exactly is a method in my case?

- network? 
  - "networks as method rather than as veracious representation of the structure of social life" (Decuypere 2020: 80)
- co-citation/bibliometric/direct analysis
- VNA

Can they be discussed in isolation?
